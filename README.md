# Kishibe

A KotlinJS library for 2D graphics in the browser.

---
Kishibe is still a work in progress and is heavily inspired by [OpenRNDR](openrndr.org). 
It might become obsolete when OpenRNDR 0.4 releases, which supports KotlinJS. So why another framework?

<b>Because I want to. </b>

All edginess aside, I've fallen deeply in love with Kotlin as a language. I'm also an active creative developer 
who has been always using other people's frameworks. So I'm making one to learn more about Kotlin and open source
software in general.
